1. How do you uncommit the changes that have already been pushed to GitHub?
   There are few ways to revert the changes which are pushed to github:
  a) Revert the commit with git revert: - This option is safer if others are working on the same branch, as it doesn't rewrite history. It creates a new commit that undoes the changes from a specific commit, so your commit history remains intact.
     git revert <commit-hash>
     To revert multiple commits, you’ll need to run git revert for each commit, starting with the most recent.
  b) Use an interactive rebase: - This option allows you to modify, reorder, or remove several recent commits in one go. It’s useful for more complex history rewrites.
     git rebase -i HEAD~n
     once finish the rebase, force push the changes:
     git push origin <branch-name> --force
  
  c) Resent and force push with git reset: - This method changes the commit history by removing the commit entirely. Use carefully on shared branches.
     git reset --hard HEAD~1
     This will reset the branch to one commit back, if you want to go further back, adjust HEAD~1 to HEAD~n where n is the number of commits to remove.
     once reset locally, force push the changes to github:
     git push origin <branch-name> --force.
       
2. If there is suddenly the file is deleted in git how do you get it back?
   There are few ways to restore the deleted files
   a) if you have deleted file locally but haven't committed the deletion, you can restore by "git checkout -- <file-path>"
   b) if you have commited but not pushed then you can restore by "git checkout head~1 -- <file-path>"
   c) if you need to recover the deleted file from a specific commit, use the commit hash. "git checkout <commit-hash> -- <file-path>"
   d) you can undo the entire commit that deleted a file:
       git revert <commit-hash>
